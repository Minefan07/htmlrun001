    <h1>Time to discuss Speedrunning.</h1><br>
    The goal of speedrunning is <c>remarkably</c> simple; not only is the name relatively self-explanatory, but it also is <c>fairly</c> straightforward to accomplish. What is required, generally speaking, is a timer of some sort, such that the speedrunner (the person actually doing it) can keep track of time. Additionally, this timer usually contains <c>multiple</c> values. In certain games, or in certain tool-assisted speedruns (TASs), the in-game time differs from the real time. Usually, TAS speedruns go either frame-by-frame or go <c>slower</c> than regular runs to enhance precision, making actions appear completed at lightning speed, once the game speed is returned to normal. See below <c>image</c>.
