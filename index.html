    <h1>Time to discuss Speedrunning.</h1><br>
    The goal of speedrunning is remarkably simple; not only is the name relatively self-explanatory, but it also is fairly straightforward to accomplish. What is required, generally speaking, is a timer of some sort, such that the speedrunner (the person actually doing it) can keep track of time. Additionally, this timer usually contains multiple values. In certain games, or in certain tool-assisted speedruns (TASs), the in-game time differs from the real time. Usually, TAS speedruns go either frame-by-frame or go slower than regular runs to enhance precision, making actions appear completed at lightning speed, once the game speed is returned to normal.
